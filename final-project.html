    User Interviews
    </a>
  </H2>


  <p id="user_re">The user interviews were very informative. The user interviews were asked to know who the audience is
    and what they expect from a website portfolio. Each individual interviewee had different aspirations and different
    goals in life. Listening to their stories and what they want to achieve is inpsiring. I learned that they all expected a
    resume along with the projects they have done and to go into detail one or two of them.

    Competitor Analysis
    </a>
  </h2>

  <p id="user_re">For the competitor analysis, I searched for other web designers' portfolios so that I have a good idea what the competition
    out there is and who I am competing against. By knowing who and how my competitor's web portfolios are, I can take ideas from
    them and add it into my own. I reviewed these specific competitors because they were all UX/UI designers but they all had very
    different ways of creating their own portfolios. With a broad range of different types of web portfolios, I can gain som insight
    of what I would like to improve my own portfolio.

    Feature Value Matrix
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p id="user_re">A feature value matrix is writing down coming up with features or functions that I think my website should have
    and I believe would benefit my users. They are ranked from important for my website and easy to implement to not too important
    and be added later on as an option feature. I chose contact information and along with my resume because they are very important
    to future potential employers because they can clearly see my credentials and what I have accomplished.
    I also added responsiveness and some usability because users should be able to navigate through my website very easily and smoothly.</p>

    Feature Prioritization
    </a>
  </h2>
    <p id="user_re">For my feature prioritization, I put interactive website as a low priority because it is something that is nice
      to have but it isn't necessary for employers or other visiting my site to have. It would be pleasant but it wouldn't the make
      or break of me getting hired for a job. Responsive was the second lowest priority because it is important to have a responsive
      website but again it is not necessary to have because employers will most likely not look at my porfolio through a phone or tablet.
      Navigation has a higher priority because I need so that users can navigate through my site without trouble looking through my
      website. Contact Information and resume are the highest priority because users and employers can see my accomplishments and
      determine whether they might consider hiring me or not. The only way to contact me is if my contact information is available
      online which maes contact information also really important and should be a high priority.

  <h2>User Testing</h2>

      User Stories
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p id="user_re">User stories are very important for the improvement of my portfolio because they give me an insight what these
      individual users might look for when they are on my portfolio. It helps me visualize what I need to improve on when I go changes
      and revise my portfolio. I came up with these type of users by taking in some personal experience and observing different type of
      users that might come across web portfolios. Professor and Students might look at a web portfolio if it was well executed and of
      course they will look for the responsiveness of the website and the interactiveness of the site while managers and companies will
      be more occupied with knowing about my resume and what I have accomplished so far.</p>

        Cognitive Walkthrough
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p id="user_re">Cognitive walkthrough is asking testers to go through my website and ask them to perform certain actions and see if they can
        go throgh them without any difficulty. The users give feedback as they are going through the actions. The cognitive walkthrough is important
        because I can get immediate feedback and I also see what fthey are doing at the moment. It helps me understand physically what they are doing
        and see what the struggles they might encounter. Some of the challenges they pointed out was that my website would get distorted if it was
        zoomed out too far and my website needs to be more responsive. I also got mixed answer about my font size. One of them said the tex was too
        small while the other volunteers said the text was okay.

    <h2 id="user_re">User Test</h2>
    <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/57e728af9a37/results/f96afaf13ecb" target="_blank">First User Test</a>
    <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/44cffdc8be32/results/61db825f5a81" target="_blank">Second User Test</a>
    <p id="user_re"> The two tests I chose to do were the click test and the Question test. I chose them because I wanted to know whether my navigation
        bar was working correctly and if it was self explanatory. I used the Question test because I wanted to know what the testers thought about my
        overall portfolio and what I could improve on it to make it more appealing. There weren't too many challenges because I realized my navigation
        bar is self explanatory. The test result was that most people clicked the About link. For the question test, I realized my text was hard to read
        They told me to use san Serif instead of Serif.</p>

  <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
  <hr>
  <p id="ps">I found out that my portfolio needs a lot of work. After conducting the user tests and cognitive walkthrough, I have learned that my portfolio
    is far from finishing. My classmates have told me that I should add much more content into it and that my picture in the middles is very awkward.
    From the user interviews, I've learned that a good portfolio requires not only a resume and contact information but also shows a glimpse of who
    I am and my personality as well. From the competitor analysis, I have some ideas of what I would like to add to my portfolio in the near future.</p>
    <p id="ps"> I knew I needed to improve on my portfolio, but I didn't know that I had that much to improve on. I definitely learned a lot from these
    researches. I will definitely continue using these research methods when i get into the industry because what i have learned from just researching
    my portfolio website is immense. I understand why companies invest so much money into these tests and research. They learn so much from conducting
    simple surveys and these tests give me a sense of direction to go towards.</p>

  <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
  <p id="ps">After doing the User Research and User Testing, I am planning to make big changes to my portfolio. The first thing I am going to do is change
    my current text and make it more readable. Next, I will make my website more responsive so that it can be viewable on a tablet or smartphone. I'll also
    add my resume and projects that I have done after I finish working on them. I will also change the background color and make my class more interactive
    to attract more users. I will definitely give some of my personality into my project so that employers have an idea of who I am and whether I'm
    compatible in their company. Some difficulties I will run into is the lack of experience I have in html, JavaScript, and CSS.</ps>
    <p id="ps">I know that these harsh comments I received from usability was well intended because I had too little in my portfolio as of right now. I am
    really happy that I did these researches because I know what I can improve on. I'll also take my time in remaking my website because I want to besure that
    I am satisfied by what I have accomplished. I like having feedback from others because they are looking at my portfolio from a different perspective
    and that is the best to understand what needs to be changed and added.
