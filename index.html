  </UL>

  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p> I have always been fascinated with technology because of its mysterious nature.
    I used to take my toys apart because I wanted to see what they were made up of and
    how was it possible to for these small components to work together and create and action
    so complex. This curiosity eventually led me to computers and I remembering being blown away
    by the how much a computer do. I had no idea that computers ran on programs because by the time
    I started using computers, there was already GUI from windows XP. But my curiosity strayed
    away when I started playing video games and all I wanted to do was build an empire in StarCraft
    or get some headshots in CounterStrike. <br><br>

    It only took me 9 years when i was a senior in High School to finally start having interest
    in how computers worked again.
    I was really into the hardware part of technology but I soon realized the software was the heart
    and soul that drove the computer. The blue screens of death, dial up, and even the lag in games were
    the result of software. I am very grateful to have made the choice to major in informatics
    because this is the major I really enjoy learning the most. Although I struggle in some subjects,
    there is a sense of reward when I finally do understand the problem that I wouldn't get from
    any other majors.
  </p>
  <h3>Other Interests</h3>
  <p> Besides coding, I enjoy playing video games. Some of the video games I play are </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dota 2</li>
      <li>Total War</li>
      <li>CounterStrike</li>
      <li>Battlefield</li>
      <li>Super Smash Bros</li>
    </ul>
  <p> When I'm not gaming, I enjoy physical activities such as basketball, swimming,
    physical training, and running.</p>

  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p> I currently know Python and Java. I am learning javascript, HTML, and CSS. I have not done
    many projects which the web programming languages. This class has definitely given me a
    deep insight of what these languages are capable of. They are powerful and have a large
    community to help anyone new to them.<br><br>

    Although I am very limited right now in what I can do, I do not plan to stay in this
    current level. I will continue to find opportunities to improve my skills and practice more
    with these languages so that I can be more comfortable with them. </p>
